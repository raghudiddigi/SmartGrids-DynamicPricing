The result files of our paper can be obtained from the Google Drive: [Link to google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10cpDXLlOWWzWjOA2Ahybb2k44mTgpjbe. )

After the experiments are done you will find the following files in the logs folder (each row will contain n space separated values, n being the number of agents):

- **adl_logger.txt** : This is used to log ADL action taken by each agent for each time step
- **battery_logger.txt** :  This is used to log amount of electricity present in the battery for each agent after each time step
- **logger_loss1.txt** : Contains the training loss of the ADL network for different agents.
- **logger_loss2.txt** : Contains the training loss of the ET network for different agents.
- **logger_updates.txt** : This is used to log average rewards for each agent every 10,000 time steps.
- **nd_logger.txt** : This is used to log the nd values (refer the paper for details of nd) for each agent after each time step.
- **price_logger.txt** : This is used to log the pricing action taken by the ET network for each agent for each time step.
- **renewable_logger.txt** : This is used to log the renewable energy generated by each agent for each time step 
- **transmission_logger.txt** : This is used to log the amount of energy traded (as decided by the ET network) for each agent at each time step.
