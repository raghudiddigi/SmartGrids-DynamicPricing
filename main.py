# Simulates transaction between the agents given their actions. It returns the rewards from trading for each agent given the actions. In this function first we divide
# the grids into buyers and sellers. Buyers are collected into a single pool. They are than matched with sellers in ascending order of their price quoted. If a seller
# is not able to fullfill the demand of the pool of buyers, than the pool moves to the next seller which again tries to satisfy the demand of the pool. If the amount to be sold is
# more than the amount to be bought, the excess electricity is sold to the main grid at Grid_Price - 5. If amount to be bought is more than  than 
# amount to be sold the excess is bought from the main grid at Grid_Price. The cost incurred by each buyer is in proportion of the amount demanded 
# times the total spending by the buyers pool. Buyers receive a negative reward while sellers receive a positive reward.  If the seller is quoting a lower price, 
# than there is a higher probability that his or her electricity will be bought by the pool of buyers.
